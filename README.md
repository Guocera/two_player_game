### Lighthouse Labs: 2 Player Game

From assignment description:
Create a 2-player guessing game where players take turns to answer simple addition problems. The math questions are 
automatically generated by the game. It should do this by picking two numbers between 1 and 20.  Both players start 
with 3 lives. They lose a life if they mis-answer a question. If a player gets a question wrong, the game should output the 
new scores for both players, so players know where they stand.  The game doesn’t end until one of the players loses all their
lives. At this point, the game should announce who won and what the other player’s score is.
